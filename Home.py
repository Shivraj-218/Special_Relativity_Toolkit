Welcome to the **Special Relativity Simulation Suite** â€” an interactive educational toolkit designed 
to explore the physical and mathematical consequences of Einstein's theory through intuitive visualizations 
and quick-access calculators.

This project was initiated as a focused academic exercise, and it evolved into a resource that may serve 
students, educators, and enthusiasts seeking accessible tools to better understand relativistic phenomena.

To learn more about the **theoretical foundations**, please refer to the accompanying paper 
[*Relativistic Kinematics and the Physical Consequences of Approaching Light Speed*]().  
For implementation details, design rationale, and code-level documentation of this suite, 
see the companion paper [*Visualizing Special Relativity: A Simulation Toolkit*]().

### ðŸ“š References and Foundations
The simulations and derivations are based on standard references including:
- David J. Griffiths, *Introduction to Electrodynamics*
- Taylor and Wheeler, *Spacetime Physics*
- Hartle, *Gravity: An Introduction to Einsteinâ€™s General Relativity*
- Lecture notes and source materials from IISER Bhopal undergraduate curriculum
